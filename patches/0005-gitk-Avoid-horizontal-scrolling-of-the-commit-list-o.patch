Subject: [PATCH 05/12] gitk: Avoid horizontal scrolling of the commit list on
 Mac

With two-finger scrolling on a track pad, horizontal scrolling
of the commit list is usually unintentional, so avoid it
completely. This means it's also no longer possible to scroll
horizontally with shift-mousewheel, but this seems like a
small price to pay.
